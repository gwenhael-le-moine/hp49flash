0. Description

This file describes the ".flash"-file format of the ROM files
for the HP 49G calculator.

1. What's going on

The flash file contains several files which have the maximum size of
128 kBytes. This is because the size of a flash ROM page is 128 kBytes.

2. The flash file header

Every flash file starts with "HPROM". I would suggest to HP to use
"49HPROM" or something because of future calcs may have flash ROMs
too but are not compatible. Well, that is my suggestion ;-)
The next byte contains the number of part files which are stored in
the flash file. Then the header of the first part file starts.

3. The header of the part file

The first byte of the part file is the length of the following filename.
This filename has to be used to store the part file to disk. The next
four bytes contain the length of the part file in bytes. Just copy this
count of bytes to the part file named as the header told you. Then the
next part file header starts and the same procedure has to be done until
all files are written.

That's it!
