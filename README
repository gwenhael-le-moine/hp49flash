Hello all you HP 49 G users :-)

Here is a small program for upgrading the OS of the calc with the serial
wire and the *.flash-files.

Still remember: this program is an early beta version!

To compile it simply type "make",
to run it type "upgrade" and follow the help-page.

You must have installed the "stty"-program and the "sx"-program (usually
in the "zmodem", or "sz" or "comm" package) to use upgrade!

To build the GUI, you need the GTK library installed. Edit Makefile
and uncomment USE_GTK. The GUI does not show the updates yet (I'd need
threads for that), so you can either look in your calc to see how things
are going or watch XTerm messages from stty. NOTE: even though the program
seems frozen, it's working.

Remark:
After upgrading there will rest the files which were unpaked in the
actual directory. From 0.2.2, files Part* and System are deleted.

Remark for programmers:
This program has got three parts: unpak, hpserial and the frontend
upgrade. If you want to make another version with a graphic user
interface you can do that and use

a) the entire program with the parameters (see the help page)
b) the unpak and hpserial parts for use in your own programs.

The first aid is to programers who program with tcl/tk while
the second is to programers who program in c.

This program is licenced under the terms of the GNU public licence.
